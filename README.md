- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @owenabbott

I started out with codeacademye. After getting the fundamentals, I enrolled in Flatiron School's immersive software engineering program. 

I felt there was more to learn. I am currently enrolled in college, studying Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
