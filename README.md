- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @owenabbott

I started out with codeacademy and teamtreehouse. After getting the fundamentals, I enrolled in Flatiron School's immersive software engineering program. 

I felt there was significantly more to learn. I am currently enrolled in college, studying software engineering at DePaul university in Chicago.
